# Brest-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Neural-Network
This project demonstrates how to build a neural network for breast cancer classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset is loaded from sklearn, preprocessed, and used to train a sequential model. The model's performance is evaluated, and a prediction system is demonstrated.
